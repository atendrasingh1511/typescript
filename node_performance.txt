Asynchronous programming
Reduce the number of dependencies
Deprecated modules, Update NPM packages
node --inspect index.js (check node profiler)

Reading and writing files asynchronously using the fs module
Making HTTP requests using the request or Axios modules
Processing vast amounts of data using streams
